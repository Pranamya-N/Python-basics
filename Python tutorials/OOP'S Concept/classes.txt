# Every variable is the oblect in oop 

# Everything is object in python and one object can be of multiple class 
for eg : i am object of my college , country etc 

# For eg :
    if there is the list denoted as L = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    here [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] are the objects of the list class 
    so basically we can say that objects comes insode classes 

# Basically class contains two types :
    1.Data or property 
    2.Functions and behaviour 

    we have a class car:
    To undetstand the concept clearly we take an example of car so in the car the data are the colour of the 
    car the engine types of the car no of wheels in the car etc etc ...

    The functions of the car are to open the airbags , gps system tracking etc etc 
    So in this way we can understand about the class clearly

#FUNCTIONS VS METHODS
METHODS ARE BASICALLY THE THE FUNCTIONS WHHICH ARE WRITTEN INSIDE THE CLASS

FOR example: WE HAVE A FUNCTION LIST AND WHEN WE DO LIST.APPEND() HERE APPEND IS THEE METHOS AND LIST
IS THE FUNCTION .

# IN CLASS WE SHOULD DELCARE THE VARIABLE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE CLASS AND THEN WE SHOULD CALL THE CLASS THE VARIABLE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE CLASS IS 
CALLED INSTANCE FOR THE EXAMPLE OF THE INSTANCE SEE THE EXAMPLE OF CLASSES . IN CLASSES THE INSTANCE IS  

# SELF IN CLASSES 
    -- THE OBJECT WHICH WE ARE WORKING IN THE PROGRAMME THE CODE ITSELF IS CALLED SELF 
    -- IN REFRENCE TO THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE OF THE CLASSES.PY WE NAMED THE INSTANCE PRANAMYA SO IN THAT CODE THE SELF IS THE INSTANCE ITSEF 
    -- NOTE: EACH TIME WE CREATE A NEW INSTANCE WE HAVE NEW SELF SO BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN WE CREATE A NEW INSTAMCE WE HAVE 
       NEW SELF

note : in the skeleton diagram of the python classes - is private class and + is public class
